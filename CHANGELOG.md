# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First public release.

- Admin page at `/admin/`: health badge with polling, token list with created, last used and request count,
  copy button, in-app revoke dialog, CPU thread control, light and dark themes, phone layout.
- Per-project tokens stored as hashes; `last_used` and `requests` are written at most once a minute per token,
  so the counters are approximate and a crash can lose up to a minute of them.
- Docker Compose deployment behind nginx with configurable replicas; guides for Docker on the same device,
  Docker on a deployment device, and no Docker.
- Browser smoke test (Playwright) and a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the tests.
