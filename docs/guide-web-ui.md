# LayaModel: the admin web UI

One page, `/admin/`, for tokens and CPU threads. It is the same for every way of running the service (Docker on the
same device, Docker on a deployment device, no Docker). Only the address differs:

| Run | Address |
|---|---|
| Docker or `run.bat` on this PC | `http://127.0.0.1:9120/admin/` |
| Docker on the deployment box | `http://<box-ip>:9120/admin/` |

If `LAYA_PORT` is changed, use that port.

## Before you open it
The page needs the admin password: the value of `LAYA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
- Docker: set it in `.env` next to `docker-compose.yml`, then `docker compose up -d`.
- No Docker: set it in the environment before starting the service (`run.bat` / `uvicorn`); the service reads the
  real environment, not `.env`.
- Empty password = no auth at all and the page answers `Admin password required (set LAYA_ADMIN_PASSWORD)`. Set
  one to use the page.

## Sign in and service status
Type the admin password and press **Sign in**. A wrong password shows an inline `Wrong admin password` error.
The password stays in `sessionStorage` for this browser tab, so reloading restores the session. **Sign out** clears
the password and any freshly created token. If browser storage is blocked, sign in again after reloading.

The header shows the service address and a health badge with an icon and text: **Healthy**, **Starting**, or
**Unreachable**. Health is checked without authentication every 10 seconds while signed in.
Tiles show models loaded out of the total, replicas, CPU threads, and active tokens.
Use **Theme** to cycle between system, light, and dark appearance; this preference is saved in the browser.

## Tokens
Each calling project gets its own token, so one can be revoked without touching the others.
- **Create:** type a project name (up to 64 characters) and press **Create token**. The token appears once in
  an accent-tinted box with a **Copy** button and the reminder “Shown once. Copy it before you leave.”
  The box is cleared on the next create attempt or sign-out. Clipboard access has a fallback for plain HTTP;
  if both methods are blocked, select the token and copy it manually.
- **Use:** the caller sends it in the `X-Internal-Token` header on every call except `/health`. Citadel: set it as
  `LAYA_TOKEN` in `apps/garrison/.env`, then `docker compose up -d` in Citadel (`restart` does not reload `env_file`).
- **List:** the table shows **Project**, **Created**, and **Last used**. Last used is **never** until a token
  authenticates a request, then a relative time; hover a timestamp for its exact local time. The list refreshes
  every 10 seconds. Token values are not shown again.
- **Revoke:** press the red-outlined **Revoke** pill and confirm in the in-app dialog, which names the project.
  **Cancel**, Escape, or a click on the backdrop closes the dialog. The caller gets `401 Invalid token` from then on. Lost
  token = revoke it and create a new one.

Last-used timestamps are Unix seconds or null. They are persisted at most once per minute per token, so they
are approximate. Old token files without the field still load and show **never** until next use. A companion
`tokens.json.lock` file serializes updates across replicas without adding dependencies.

Tokens live in `tokens.json` (`LAYA_TOKENS_FILE`). In Docker that is the `tokens` volume at `/data`, so they survive
`docker compose down` and rebuilds. Without Docker it is `tokens.json` in the folder the service starts from. Tokens
are enforced only while `LAYA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is set.

## Torch CPU threads
Use the synchronized slider or number field, then **Apply**. Both accept 1 to 256. Apply is disabled and
shows a busy indicator during saving; a short **Saved** confirmation follows. The page states:
“Saved to settings.json. Other replicas apply it on restart.”
- Sets how many CPU threads torch uses for each prediction. In a container with a CPU quota torch still counts the
  host's cores, and more threads than the quota makes each prediction several times slower. Start near the number
  of cores the container may use.
- Range 1 to 256. The field shows the value in use now.
- The change applies at once to the replica that answers the click and is saved to `settings.json` next to
  `tokens.json`. Other replicas pick it up when they restart: `docker compose restart laya`.
- The saved value beats `LAYA_TORCH_THREADS` from `.env`. Remove `settings.json` from the `/data` volume to go back
  to the `.env` value.
- `GET /health` reports the value in use as `torch_threads`.

## Replicas (read-only)
The replicas tile and muted line **Replicas: N. Change LAYA_REPLICAS in .env, then rebuild.** show `LAYA_REPLICAS`.
The page cannot change it; each replica loads its own copy of the models, so it multiplies RAM. To change it, set `LAYA_REPLICAS` in `.env`, then:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose restart laya_lb
```
`Replicas: unknown` means the variable is not set, which is normal without Docker.

## Problems
| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Page does not load | Service not running, wrong port, or blocked by a firewall. Test `/health`. |
| `Wrong admin password` | Password differs from `LAYA_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the running container. Recreate it after editing `.env`. |
| `Admin password required (set LAYA_ADMIN_PASSWORD)` | The password is empty. Set it and restart. |
| Token lost | Revoke it and create a new one. |
| Thread change gone after restart | Other replicas load the saved value only on restart; check `/health` on each. |
| Page works over plain `http` only | Expected on a LAN. Never expose port 9120 to the internet. |
